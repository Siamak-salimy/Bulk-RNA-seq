# Bulk-RNA-seq 
Bulk RNA-seq, also known as bulked RNA sequencing, is a high-throughput sequencing technique used to analyze the transcriptome of a population of cells. It provides information about the gene expression patterns in a mixture of cells, rather than on a single-cell level. Bulk RNA-seq is widely used in genomics research and has contributed to our understanding of gene expression, regulatory mechanisms, and the identification of novel biomarkers.</br> 

The general workflow of bulk RNA-seq involves the following steps:</br>  

1. Sample collection and preparation: Biological samples, such as tissues or cell populations, are collected and processed to extract total RNA. The RNA extraction process involves breaking open the cells, isolating the RNA molecules, and removing contaminants. 
2.

3. RNA library preparation: The extracted RNA is converted into a sequencing library through several enzymatic steps. Initially, the RNA is fragmented into smaller pieces, followed by the addition of adapters to the fragments. These adapters contain sequences necessary for sequencing and enable the fragments to bind to the sequencing platform.</br>

4. Sequencing: The prepared library is loaded onto a next-generation sequencing platform, such as Illumina or Ion Torrent, where millions of sequencing reactions take place simultaneously. During sequencing, the complementary DNA (cDNA) fragments are amplified and sequenced by synthesis, generating a large number of short reads.</br>

5. Read alignment and quantification: The generated reads are then aligned to a reference genome or a transcriptome database using specialized bioinformatics tools. This step identifies the genomic location or the transcript from which each read originated. The number of reads that map to each gene or transcript is used as a measure of its expression level.</br>

6. Data analysis: After read alignment and quantification, various computational methods and statistical analyses are employed to identify differentially expressed genes, discover novel transcripts, and perform downstream analyses, such as pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis.</br>

Bulk RNA-seq has several advantages, including its relative simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to capture the overall gene expression profile of a population of cells. It has been widely used in studies ranging from basic research to clinical applications, such as identifying disease-related genes, studying developmental processes, and monitoring treatment responses.</br>

However, bulk RNA-seq has limitations, particularly in capturing heterogeneity within a population of cells. Since it measures the average gene expression of all cells in the sample, it cannot distinguish between different cell types or identify rare cell populations. To address these limitations, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have been developed, allowing for the analysis of gene expression profiles at the individual cell level.
